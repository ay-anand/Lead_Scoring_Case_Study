# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Objective:

___X Education, an educational company, specializes in selling online courses to professionals within various industries. Each day, numerous professionals interested in the courses visit the company's website to explore available options. The company promotes its courses on multiple platforms, including various websites and search engines such as Google. Upon landing on the website, visitors may browse courses, fill out course-related forms, or watch instructional videos. Individuals who provide their email addresses or phone numbers through these forms are classified as leads. Additionally, the company obtains leads through referrals. Subsequently, the sales team initiates contact with these leads through calls and emails, aiming to convert them into customers. However, the current lead conversion rate stands at approximately 30%, indicating a need for improvement.___

___X Education aims to enhance efficiency by identifying high-potential leads, referred to as 'Hot Leads.' This strategic identification of leads should result in an increased lead conversion rate, as the sales team can focus on communicating with the most promising leads rather than reaching out to everyone indiscriminately. To achieve this goal, the company proposes building a logistic regression model. This model will assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, providing a tool for targeting potential leads. A higher score signifies a hot lead, more likely to convert, while a lower score indicates a cold lead with a lower likelihood of conversion.___

___The logistic regression model should also be adaptable to address potential future changes in the company's requirements. Any additional challenges or modifications in the company's approach can be accommodated by the model. These specific challenges are outlined in a separate document, and the logistic regression model should be designed to handle them. The results of the model, along with its recommendations, should be included in the final PowerPoint presentation.___
